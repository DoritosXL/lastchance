## Features

### 1. Emoji Grid Creation
- Generate a 4x3 grid of random emojis from popular categories like `people`, `foods`, and `smileys`.
- Edit individual grid slots by selecting or deleting emojis.
- Clear all emojis or regenerate a new grid.

### 2. Custom Backgrounds
- Choose a background color using the integrated `TwitterPicker` color picker.
- Dynamic naming of downloaded images based on the background color and content of the grid:
  - `CLB.png`: Default file name.
  - `DONDA.png`: Empty grid (black background).

### 3. Download Functionality
- Download the grid as a PNG file.
- Emojis and grid layout are preserved in the downloaded image.
- The grid is spaced evenly and dynamically adapts to the selected design.

### 4. Responsive Design
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- Buttons, grids, and pickers shrink or grow appropriately based on screen size.

### 5. Theme Switching
- Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Smooth transition animations when switching themes.

## How It Works

1. **Emoji Data**:
   - Uses `@emoji-mart/data` to fetch and display emojis.
   - Only emojis with native representations are included.

2. **Grid Management**:
   - Each grid slot can hold one emoji.
   - Users can edit or clear slots individually or in bulk.

3. **Canvas Drawing**:
   - The grid is rendered on a hidden canvas during download.
   - Emojis and background color are drawn dynamically.

4. **File Naming Logic**:
   - Grid content and background color determine the downloaded file name.
